# Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard application that allows a user to search for a city and view current and future weather conditions for that city. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes third-party APIs - OpenWeatherMap and Moment.js - to retrieve and display weather data.

As a web developer, building the Weather Dashboard challenged me to work with third-party APIs and dynamically update HTML and CSS. By completing this project, I gained practical experience with key web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as the ability to work with APIs and JSON data.

In addition to building a functional weather dashboard, this project helped me develop problem-solving skills and the ability to work with server-side technologies. Overall, completing the Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard was an important step in my development as a web developer and prepared me for future web development challenges.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Functionality

The Weather Dashboard allows users to:

- Search for a city and view current and future weather conditions for that city
- View the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed for current weather conditions
- View a 5-day forecast that displays the date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day
- Add cities to the search history for easy access

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Moment.js library

## Acknowledgements

This project was completed as part of a Server-Side APIs Challenge, with the instructions provided by my teacher. I utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and the Moment.js library to handle date and time functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Weather Dashboard, simply open the link at the bottom of the readme. Enter a city name in the search bar and click the search button to retrieve current and future weather conditions for that city. The current weather conditions and 5-day forecast will be displayed, along with a list of recent searches for easy access.
