## Description

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that enables users to search for the current and future weather conditions of multiple cities. It utilizes the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to display the weather information. As a new developer, this project has been significant in my growth as it allowed me to gain hands-on experience in working with third-party APIs, making API requests, and handling JSON data. I implemented features such as search functionality, displaying current weather conditions, and a 5-day forecast, which deepened my understanding of JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Moreover, I improved my problem-solving skills by troubleshooting API integration and data rendering. The project also introduced me to responsive design and the use of Bootstrap for styling web applications. Leveraging Bootstrap's CSS framework, I created a visually appealing and user-friendly weather dashboard. Overall, the Weather Dashboard project played a crucial role in building my confidence as a developer and expanding my knowledge of web development technologies. It provided a practical application of the skills I have learned and reinforced the importance of continuous learning in the field of software development.
